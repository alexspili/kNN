# kNN
Demo of the k-Nearest Neighbors algorithm

To view this, click [here]

Clicking changes the state of a point in this order:
[ Create a new red point, convert a red point to blue, delete a blue point ]
or drag points to move them around

When a point has an equal number of blue and red neighbors, blue wins!
